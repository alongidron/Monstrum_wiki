## Characters

### First Deities

The first deities are the most powerful creatures in Monstrum. Monstrum creates them to entertain himself because, after all, he is just a planet, so he can't really do much besides enjoy seeing the creatures living on him.  
The first deities have the most important roles, so Monstrum made sure they would be unkillable. If they somehow die, there will be a major catastrophe in the world.

### The Second Gods

The second gods were made by the first deities, the dragons, or by Monstrum. The second gods aren't as powerful as the first deities, even though some of them created their own magic course. If one of them dies, nothing significant will happen because they can be replaced.  
Not all the second gods consider themselves gods, and not all of them have important duties, but they are all very powerful creatures.
