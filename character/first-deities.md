# Supreme Deities - Monstrum Wiki

The Supreme Deities are the most powerful creatures in Monstrum. Monstrum created some of them to entertain himself because he is just a planet and enjoys watching the creatures living on him and some got trop by him.   
some of The Supreme Deities have the most important roles, so Monstrum made sure they would be unkillable. If they somehow die, there will be a major catastrophe in the world.
