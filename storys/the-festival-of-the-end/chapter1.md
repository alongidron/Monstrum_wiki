# Chapter 1 - 

---

 Gaster Stone, the once-mighty demon lord, had grown weary of his existence. Nestled in his nearly impenetrable fortress in North Rostsoul, he had carved out a realm of chaos and conquest. The bitter cold, the snow-laden forests, and the treacherous terrain made his castle impossible to breach, and his powerful defensive magic kept any threats at bay. In the beginning, Gaster reveled in the disorder he created, sending out troops to sow chaos across the lands. But as time passed, he realized the cost of endless warfare—it drained his resources and left him unsatisfied. Over time, he had found peace, but peace quickly turned to boredom.

Desperate for a new thrill, Gaster scoured his vast collection of old tomes. His eyes lit up when he stumbled upon a dusty book titled _"The Hardest Worlds to Conquer."_ The challenge reignited the fire within him. Conquering an unconquerable world? It was exactly what he needed. Eager to share his discovery, he summoned his most trusted commanders for an urgent meeting.

"Hmmm, lads," Gaster began, his voice tinged with excitement, "is anyone interested in conquering one of the unconquerable worlds?" His smile was sly, expecting to see the same thrill in his commanders' eyes that he felt in his chest.

Koronis, ever the loyal second-in-command, responded immediately. "It doesn't matter what we want, you are the leader, and we will follow you to the end no matter what," he said, his words as dutiful as ever. But the reaction from the other commanders was not what Gaster had hoped for.

Lily, her patience already worn thin, snapped first. "Is this really why you summoned us? Another war? Some of us are busy!" Her irritation was palpable, the exhaustion of centuries of fighting weighing heavily on her.

Kanik, always the one to add a sarcastic quip, rolled his eyes. "As fun as it sounds, I'm not interested in some stupid and pointless wars."

Then there was Jevel, who was rarely one for words but made his point clear. "We have enough souls," he said bluntly. "We don’t need more."

Gaster felt his heart sink. His excitement dwindled as the weight of their lack of enthusiasm hit him. These were his trusted commanders, his comrades in battle, and yet they seemed indifferent to his grand plan. "Why are you all like this?" he asked, his voice betraying his frustration and hurt.

Gaster had expected excitement, a shared desire to embark on something great. Instead, he found himself questioning the loyalty and ambition of his own team. His thrill for conquest was not matched by those who stood by him, and for the first time, he felt disconnected from the very people he had trusted for so long.

As the silence in the room stretched on, Gaster began to wonder if his own thirst for conquest had isolated him from his commanders.
